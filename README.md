# final_project
My final project I made for the P12 examination I made in two weeks.

The project is inspired by the real CRM app my project partner used at work. The main function of the app is to store and navigate data about the clients & their cases. It has several tables with filtering, which rows are colored depending on the start and end dates of their insurance coverage. 

It also features authentication, restricted access from non-registered users and extended user models. 

Although the app in many respects is unpolished, I think that it well encapsulated the things I knew at the time.

In this project I used:
- Django
- Django-filters, an external module for Django
- Bootstrap
- A little bit of jQuerry

Skills I used:
- Knowledge of Django tools and concepts. Views, URLconfs, forms, templating engine, models, ORM, context processors...
- Knowledge of flexbox and Bootstrap. I was one of two people who made their own frontend, which I learned separately from the course.
- Knowledge of jQuerry which I also learned separately.
- Organizational skills. I did this project with a partner, who was behind the course, but we still coded together and did good.
